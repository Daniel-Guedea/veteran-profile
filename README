  I setup my heroku using these steps https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys

  what next?  maybe move personalized info into a yaml file so the image info, twitter, github, and linked in are pulled from yaml and I use erb to parse.  Right now sinatra is a bit overkill since there is no data processing.

  Done with the personalizing...

modify config/personal_settings with your values 
put an image in public/images/your_file.jpg
Image dimensions that looked good for me - 2180 x 2811

name : YOUR_NAME
twitter : YOUR_TWITTER
linkedin : YOUR_LINKEDIN
github : YOUR_GITHUB
email : FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME@gmail.com
working_with_rails : nil
personal_image : /images/YOU_FILE_NAME.jpg
personal_site : http://www.YOURDOMAIN.com
job_title: SOFTWARE ENGINEER OF YOUR CHOOSING
hire_availability : unavailable

  Added in some generation of the resume as a pdf.  Perhaps need to look into moving these to a views folder as there are now two views.  Also need separate style sheet for PDF.  It doesn't look as good.

  This was super helpful - http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2010/06/15/rethinking-pdf-creation-in-ruby

The pdf function only works on Heroku :(
Need to make this more useful for others
